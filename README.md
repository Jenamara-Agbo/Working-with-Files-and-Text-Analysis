# README: Working with Files and Text Analysis

This project explores file handling in Python, emphasizing reading and writing files, processing text, and analyzing word frequencies. Highlights include:

## File Operations:
- **Writing to Files**: Demonstrates how to save text using the `open()` function in write mode (`'w'`).
- **Reading Files**: Covers methods like `read()`, `readlines()`, and iterating line-by-line to handle small and large files efficiently.
- **Applications**: Using file operations to process and analyze text.

## Text Analysis:
- **Presidential Speeches**:
  - Extracts, tokenizes, and cleans text from U.S. inaugural addresses.
  - Removes stopwords and visualizes word frequency distributions using `matplotlib`.
  - Compares speeches thematically (e.g., political ideals, socio-cultural references).
- **Advanced Techniques**:
  - **Bigram Analysis**: Identifies common word pairs.
  - **Lexical Diversity**: Measures richness of vocabulary in speeches.
  - **Thematic Comparisons**: Tracks thematic words (e.g., "freedom") over time.
  - **Correlation**: Examines speeches during specific historical periods for thematic similarities.

## Web Scraping:
- **Text Extraction**: Scrapes and processes online documents using Beautiful Soup.
- **Analysis**: Cleans data, removes stopwords, and visualizes key themes in scraped content.

## Summarization:
- **Techniques**:
  - **Extractive Summarization**: Highlights key sentences based on importance.
  - **Abstractive Summarization**: Generates concise, coherent summaries of text.
- **Comparison**:
  - Explores traditional algorithms like Luhn and modern approaches like LexRank.
  - Uses ChatGPT for both extractive and abstractive summarization to demonstrate AI capabilities.

This repository showcases practical methods for handling files and performing insightful text analysis, making it a versatile resource for Python learners and data enthusiasts.
